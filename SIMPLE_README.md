## 💡 How It Works

- **Performance Indexes** - Fast queries even with lots of data

### **Smart Rate Limiting**

## 📈 Expected Performance

- **Mentions/Hour**: 50-200 (typical brand)
- **Data Completeness**: 95%+ of all mentions
- **Startup Time**: Immediate (starts collecting right away)
- **Response Time**: Real-time (mentions appear within 1-5 minutes)

## 🛠️ Commercial Features

### **White-Label Ready**
- Easy to rebrand interface
- Single file = easy deployment
- No external dependencies

### **Client-Friendly**
- **One Reddit app** per client (vs 3+ in other solutions)
- Simple credential setup
- Self-contained deployment

### **Scalable**
- Each client gets own instance
- SQLite handles 100k+ mentions easily
- Can upgrade to PostgreSQL if needed

## 🔒 Production Tips

### **Security**
- Keep API credentials in environment variables
- Run behind reverse proxy (nginx) for HTTPS
- Use process manager (PM2, systemd) for stability

### **Monitoring**
- Check `/health` endpoint for status
- Monitor log files for errors
- Set up alerts for downtime

### **Backup**
- Database file: `reddit_monitor.db`
- Configuration: `.env` file
- Backup these files regularly

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **No Mentions Appearing**
1. Check Reddit credentials in `.env`
2. Verify brand names in CONFIG
3. Check `/system_status` for data source health

### **Sentiment Analysis Not Working**
1. Verify HuggingFace token in `.env`
2. Check internet connection
3. System works without sentiment (optional feature)

### **Web Interface Not Loading**
1. Check if port 5000 is available
2. Look for error messages in console
3. Try different port in CONFIG

### **Rate Limiting Issues**
1. System handles this automatically
2. Check logs for rate limit messages
3. Multiple data sources provide redundancy
